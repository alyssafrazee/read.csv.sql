\title{Helper function for read.csv.sql}
\usage{
ostrapply(X, pattern, FUN = function(x, ...) x, ignore.case = FALSE, ...,
  empty = NULL, simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE, combine = c)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{list or (atomic) vector of character strings to be used}

\item{pattern}{character string containing a regular (or character string for
\code{fixed=TRUE} to be matched in the given character vector.}

\item{FUN}{a function, formula, character string, list or proto object to be
applied to each element of \code{X}. See discussion in \code{\link{gsubfn}.}}

\item{ignore.case}{If \code{TRUE} then case is ignored in the \code{pattern}
argument.}

\item{\dots}{optional arguments to \code{gsubfn}.}

\item{empty}{If there is no match to a string return this value.}

\item{simplify}{logical or function. If logical, should the result be
simplified to a vector or matrix, as in \code{sapply} if possible? If
function, that function is applied to the result with each component of the
result passed as a separate argument. Typically if the form is used it will
typically be specified as rbind.}

\item{USE.NAMES}{logical; if \code{TRUE} and if \code{X} is character, use
\code{X} as 'names' for the result unless it had names already.}

\item{combine}{combine is a function applied to the components of the result
of \code{FUN}. The default is \code{"c"}. \code{"list"} is another common
choice. The default may change to be \code{"list"} in the future.}
}
\value{
A list of character strings.
}
\description{
Same as the \code{strapply} or \code{ostrapply} functions in \code{gsubfn}
package, but with \code{tcltk} capabilities removed.
}
\details{
See \code{strapply} in \code{gsubfn}.  In the tornado package this function
should rarely be called on its own.  It is an internal process of
\code{read.csv.sql}, which is an internal process of \code{makeDb}.
