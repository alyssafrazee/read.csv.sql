\title{Helper function for read.csv.sql}
\usage{
strapply(X, pattern, FUN = function(x, ...) x, backref = NULL, ...,
  empty = NULL, ignore.case = FALSE, perl = TRUE, engine = "R",
  simplify = FALSE, USE.NAMES = FALSE, combine = c)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{list or (atomic) vector of character strings to be used}

\item{pattern}{character string containing a regular (or character string for
\code{fixed=TRUE} to be matched in the given character vector.}

\item{FUN}{a function, formula, character string, list or proto object to be
applied to each element of \code{X}. See discussion in \code{\link{gsubfn}.}}

\item{backref}{see \code{gsubfn}}

\item{\dots}{optional arguments to \code{gsubfn}}

\item{empty}{If there is no match to a string return this value.}

\item{ignore.case}{If TRUE then case is ignored in the \code{pattern}
argument.}

\item{perl}{If TRUE then \code{engine="R"} is used with perl regular
expressions.  It is required to keep this argument at TRUE, since \code{tcl}
engine capabilities have been removed from this function.}

\item{engine}{Should always be set to \code{"R"}, since the \code{tcl} engine
is not available in the tornado package.}

\item{simplify}{logical or function. If logical, should the result be
simplified to a vector or matrix, as in \code{sapply} if possible? If
function, that function is applied to the result with each component of the
result passed as a separate argument. Typically if the form is used it will
typically be specified as rbind.}

\item{USE.NAMES}{logical; if \code{TRUE} and if \code{X} is character, use
\code{X} as 'names' for the result unless it had names already.}

\item{combine}{combine is a function applied to the components of the result
of \code{FUN}. The default is \code{"c"}. \code{"list"} is another common
choice. The default may change to be \code{"list"} in the future.}
}
\value{
A list of character strings
}
\description{
The same as \code{strapply} in the \code{gsubfn} package, but with
\code{tcltk} capabilities removed.
}
\details{
See details in \code{gsubfn} package.
}
\note{
Does not need to be used directly in tornado; \code{makeDb} wraps this
entirely.
