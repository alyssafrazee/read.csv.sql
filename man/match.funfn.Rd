\name{match.funfn}
\alias{match.funfn}
\title{Generic extended version of R match.fun}
\usage{
match.funfn(FUN, descend = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{Function, character name of function or formula describing
function.}

\item{descend}{logical; control whether to search past non-function objects.}
}
\value{
Returns a function.
}
\description{
A generic \code{match.fun}.
}
\details{
The default method is the same as \code{match.fun} and the \code{formula}
method is the same as \code{as.function.formula}.  This function can be used
within the body of a function to convert a function specification whether its
a function, character string or formula into an actual function.
}
\note{
This is exactly the same as \code{match.funfn} in the \code{gsubfn}
package.  Do not load the \code{gsubfn} package to use this function, as
\code{gsubfn} loads \code{tcltk}, which is not advised.
